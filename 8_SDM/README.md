Scripts to perform the entire ecological niche modelling.

1. 1_SDM.R; for species distribution modelling, to determine suitable habitats at both time points (Last Glacial Maximum and today).
2. 2_PCA.R and 3_Space3D.R; for the construction of the multidimensional climatic space.
3. 4_FiguresRGB.R and 5_Figures ContributionPC_EuropeLevel.R; for figures reproduction.
4. 6_ClimaticConvergenceRefugia.R and 7_RefugiaClimaticDistances.R; for the investigation of climatic convergence across glacial refugia, see Supplementary Material of the paper.
