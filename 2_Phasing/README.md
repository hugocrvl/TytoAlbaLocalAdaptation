Scripts necessary to phase genetic variants.

1. 1.1_WhatsHap.sh phases per individual and 1.2_MergingIndividualPhasing.sh merges the output.
2. 2.1_ShapeIt.sh phases per scaffold and 2.2_MergingScaffoldPhaing.sh merges the output.

The files in the 0_AdditionalFiles directory were used during the phasing process as input and output variables
